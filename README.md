# ODIN LANDING PAGE

This project is part of **The Odin Project’s Foundations Course**.
It’s a simple landing page created to practice fundamental HTML and CSS concepts, including layout design using **Flexbox**.

### This project includes:

- A fully structured landing page built from a provided design reference
- A header with navigation links and a hero section
- An information section showcasing features or highlights
- A testimonial/quote section and a call-to-action banner
- A responsive footer with credits

### Through this project, I practiced and demonstrated:

- Structuring a webpage using semantic **HTML5**
- Styling and layout techniques with **CSS3**
- Using **Flexbox** to align and distribute elements effectively
- Applying consistent design principles such as spacing, typography, and color
